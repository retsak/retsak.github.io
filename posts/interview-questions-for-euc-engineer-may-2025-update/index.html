<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The role of an End-User Computing (EUC) Engineer has evolved significantly in the past year. Traditionally, an EUC Engineer manages endpoint devices, provides technical support, ensures security compliance, and collaborates with IT teams for optimal performance. However, as of May 2025, the EUC landscape is rapidly changing. New technologies and practices – from AI-powered assistants to cloud-based desktops – are reshaping how EUC engineers work. This updated guide (<a href="https://www.brewedandmanaged.com/2024/12/interview-questions-for-euc-engineer.html">originally published in December 2024</a>) revisits common interview questions for EUC engineer candidates and modernizes them to reflect current trends. We will incorporate key pillars of 2025’s IT environment, including Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Cloud PC, agentic AI, Zero Trust security, Unified Endpoint Management (UEM), and automation-driven management. Whether you’re an interviewer or a candidate, these updated insights and questions will help you focus on the skills and knowledge that matter most in EUC today.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolving-euc-landscape-in-2025">The Evolving EUC Landscape in 2025</h2>
<p>Modern end-user computing is no longer just about troubleshooting desktops – it’s about enabling productivity anywhere, on any device, securely. Two big drivers are the hybrid workforce and AI integration. Companies now support flexible work-from-anywhere setups while also empowering employees with AI tools for efficiency. This introduces new challenges: for example, 85% of organizations report employees accessing company systems from unmanaged devices, creating security gaps. EUC engineers must respond by implementing Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions to reduce complexity, increase visibility, and secure all endpoints from a “single pane of glass”. At the same time, they need strategies for integrating AI into workflows without compromising data protection.
Another major change in 2025 is the push to modernize operating systems and infrastructure. With Windows 10 support ending in October 2025, organizations are accelerating migrations to Windows 11. Many see this as an opportunity to adopt more cloud-first, modern management approaches for both physical and virtual desktops. The EUC domain is also adapting to industry shifts – for instance, VMware’s EUC products are now under the “Omnissa” brand after acquisition, and Citrix is refocusing on its core virtualization offerings. Overall, an EUC engineer interviewing in 2025 is expected to understand not only traditional desktop management, but also cloud services, identity-driven security models, and the productivity gains (and risks) of AI tools. Interview questions will reflect this broader scope.</p>
<h2 id="embracing-ai-in-euc-copilots-and-intelligent-agents">Embracing AI in EUC: Copilots and Intelligent Agents</h2>
<p>One of the most transformative trends in 2025 is the integration of AI into end-user computing. Microsoft has woven AI deeply into its ecosystem – from Microsoft 365 Copilot in Office apps to Windows Copilot in Windows 11 – turning AI into an “everyday companion” for users. In fact, the latest Windows 11 devices even include a Copilot key on the keyboard, making it seamless to invoke the AI assistant as part of your daily workflow. For EUC engineers, this means supporting users who rely on AI for tasks like generating content, analyzing data, or even adjusting system settings. It also means managing the deployment and governance of these AI features. For example, enterprise device policies might control what Copilot can access or ensure that AI-driven features like “Recall” (which logs user context) don’t violate compliance rules.
Beyond user-facing copilots, we’re also seeing the rise of agentic AI in IT operations. These are background AI agents that autonomously assist with IT tasks. Microsoft Intune (Endpoint Manager) has introduced Security Copilot agents – the first being a Vulnerability Remediation Agent (in preview as of May 2025) that uses AI to automatically detect and remediate endpoint vulnerabilities. Such agents represent “adaptive automation” that can boost IT productivity by handling routine security tasks and recommending fixes. The key for candidates is to grasp that AI in EUC is an enabler, not a replacement for IT pros. Companies still need humans to guide AI and ensure quality outcomes. In interviews, expect questions on how you would leverage AI tools to improve workflows (e.g. using an Intune AI assistant to create policies or troubleshoot issues), as well as how you’d mitigate risks. Shadow AI is a real concern – even if a company doesn’t officially allow AI tools, users may secretly use them, potentially exposing data. Forward-thinking EUC engineers should have ideas for an “AI usage policy” that balances innovation with compliance. For instance, Intune now offers controls to allow employees to benefit from AI apps on their devices while preventing data leaks (such as blocking screenshots or clipboard access in those AI apps). Knowing how to configure such policies is a valuable skill.
Equally important is the emergence of AI agents as digital coworkers for end users. We’re moving past simple chatbots to context-aware virtual assistants embedded in the workspace. These intelligent agents can handle routine tasks, filter information, predict user needs, and even provide personalized guidance or training. Rather than replacing employees, they augment human roles by offloading low-value tasks and ensuring consistency and compliance in the background. An EUC engineer might be asked how to support or manage these AI-driven assistants – for example, how to integrate an AI chatbot into a service desk, or how to deploy an AI coaching tool for employees while respecting privacy. Demonstrating familiarity with concepts like agentic AI and citing their benefits (e.g. improved productivity, proactive issue resolution) will show that you’re keeping up with the cutting edge of EUC technology.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-pcs-and-modern-workspace-delivery-microsoft-cloud-pc">Cloud PCs and Modern Workspace Delivery (Microsoft Cloud PC)</h2>
<p>Virtual desktops and cloud-delivered workspaces have become core to EUC strategy in 2025. Microsoft’s Windows 365 Cloud PC (often just called Microsoft Cloud PC or MCP) is a prime example – it’s a service that provides a personal, persistent Windows desktop in the Microsoft Cloud, accessible from any device. In fact, Windows 365 has seen rapid adoption (reportedly used by over half of Fortune 500 companies) as organizations embrace flexible work arrangements. An EUC engineer today should be comfortable discussing how Cloud PCs are set up and managed, and how they compare to traditional VDI or other DaaS (Desktop-as-a-Service) solutions.
Windows 365 Cloud PC high-level architecture: End-users on various clients authenticate via Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and connect to a Cloud PC through the Windows 365 service. Cloud PCs can be Azure AD joined or Hybrid AD joined depending on organizational needs, and are managed by endpoint management tools like Microsoft Intune. This cloud-based approach provides a full Windows experience without local infrastructure, enhancing flexibility and security. 
Microsoft Cloud PC comes in two flavors – Enterprise Cloud PCs, which integrate with Intune/UEM for full corporate management, and Business Cloud PCs, a simpler offering for small businesses or individuals, managed by the user. In an interview, you might be asked about scenarios where a Cloud PC is beneficial: for example, onboarding a remote contractor with a secure virtual desktop, or rapidly equipping seasonal staff with company desktops without shipping hardware. A strong candidate can talk about benefits of Cloud PCs such as: centralized data (reducing the endpoint threat surface), quick scalability, and easier compliance since everything is in the cloud environment.
Be prepared for technical questions on Cloud PC integration as well. For instance, how to handle identity and access – most likely via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with Conditional Access to restrict who can login to Cloud PCs. Or how networking works – e.g. Enterprise Cloud PCs can be connected to a customer’s Azure virtual network for hybrid connectivity (vNet injection for domain join, etc.), whereas Business Cloud PCs are fully Microsoft-hosted. Interviewers may also explore your knowledge of Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) vs. Windows 365. You should know that under the hood, Windows 365 is built on AVD technology, but AVD allows more customization (multi-session hosts, custom scaling) while Cloud PC focuses on simplicity with fixed pricing. Being able to articulate these points shows you can design the right solution for a given use-case.
Finally, mention any current developments: for example, Microsoft’s introduction of the Windows 365 Frontline licenses (for part-time or shift workers) and the upcoming Windows 365 Link device (a tiny cloud PC client announced at Ignite) which underscore how central Cloud PC is becoming to Microsoft’s EUC strategy. An interviewer might ask how you’d incorporate Cloud PCs into a hybrid environment – a good answer could cover identity integration (hybrid AD join vs. cloud-only), endpoint management via Intune, security controls, and user experience considerations (like ensuring network connectivity and peripherals work seamlessly over the remote session).</p>
<h2 id="zero-trust-security-and-identity-driven-protection">Zero Trust Security and Identity-Driven Protection</h2>
<p>Security in EUC has shifted from traditional perimeter defense to a Zero Trust model. Zero Trust means “never trust, always verify” – every access request by a device or user is continuously authenticated and authorized based on identity, device state, and context. In 2025, this approach is widely embraced, especially as devices roam between home, office, and cloud environments. Identity has become the new perimeter, so EUC engineers must work closely with identity and security teams to enforce policies on who or what can access corporate resources. Expect interview questions on how you implement Zero Trust principles for endpoint computing. For instance, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies via Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) are table stakes – you should be able to describe setting up conditional access rules that allow Cloud PC or SaaS access only from compliant devices and trusted locations.
Device compliance is another pillar of Zero Trust. An interviewer may pose a scenario like: “How do you ensure that only secure, compliant devices connect to the corporate network or cloud services?” A strong answer would mention using Intune compliance policies (or equivalent UEM policies) to check device health (OS version, patch level, encryption status, etc.) and then leveraging conditional access to block or remediate non-compliant devices. For Cloud PC specifically, Microsoft built it with Zero Trust in mind – securing identity, the device, and data in the Cloud PC environment across all six pillars of Zero Trust. You might reference that Windows 365 has features like just-in-time privileged access, integration with Defender for endpoint threat protection, and vTPM + Secure Boot enabled on all Cloud PC VMs by default for hardware-level security.
In 2025, identity-driven security also extends to how we handle AI and cloud services. EUC engineers should be aware of tools like Microsoft Entra ID Protection (which uses AI to detect risky sign-ins) and how to interpret its signals in an endpoint management context. Also, mention Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions if relevant – for example, replacing legacy VPN with something like Azure AD Application Proxy or other ZTNA to give users secure remote access per application. An interview question could be: “Describe how you would implement a Zero Trust framework for a new fleet of corporate laptops.” Here you’d talk about steps like: enrolling devices in Intune for management, enforcing compliance (encryption, AV, updates), requiring user MFA, using least-privilege access (perhaps via endpoint privilege management), and continuous monitoring via tools (endpoint detection &amp; response logs, etc.). Mentioning popular frameworks (like Google BeyondCorp or NIST SP 800-207 for Zero Trust) isn’t a bad idea to show you know the theory, but focus on practical measures an EUC engineer takes – conditional access, device compliance, identity verification, and data protection policies are key points to hit.</p>
<h2 id="unified-endpoint-management-and-automation">Unified Endpoint Management and Automation</h2>
<p>Gone are the days of managing PCs with one tool and mobile devices with another. Today’s expectation is that EUC engineers are proficient in Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) – a single strategy to manage all endpoints (desktops, laptops, mobile devices, VDI, Cloud PCs, IoT) in a unified way. Microsoft Intune is one leading UEM platform (formerly part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager), and it provides a cloud-native solution to manage Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and even specialized devices. In interview discussions, highlight that UEM consolidates device management, application management, and identity/access management into one pane. For example, Intune allows an admin to manage a Windows 11 laptop, an iPhone, and a Cloud PC all in one interface, with consistent policy deployment and compliance reporting. This unified approach reduces the “tool sprawl” and gaps that we discussed earlier, improving both security and operational efficiency.
A good candidate will be familiar with policy-based management concepts. This means defining desired state via policies (config profiles, compliance rules, app protection policies, etc.) and letting the system enforce them automatically. You might be asked about specific policy types – e.g., what is a configuration profile in Intune versus a Group Policy in traditional AD, and how do they differ? Or how do App Protection Policies allow control of corporate data within apps on unmanaged devices (MAM, mobile application management). Another likely topic is automation in endpoint management. Microsoft and other UEM vendors are infusing automation through AI (as mentioned) and through orchestration features. For example, Intune’s new AI “Support Assistant” can help IT admins troubleshoot and resolve issues faster by leveraging a knowledge base and even suggest fixes. Ivanti Neurons (another UEM tool) touts “self-healing” endpoints – automated scripts that trigger when a device reports an issue, fixing it without human intervention. Be ready to discuss any experience you have with automating tasks: maybe using PowerShell/Graph API to bulk-enroll devices, setting up automated software updates with Microsoft Autopatch, or using conditional access in tandem with compliance policies to auto-quarantine risky devices.
One hot area within UEM is endpoint analytics and experience monitoring. Interviewers may ask how you ensure a good digital employee experience. Here you can mention tools like Microsoft Endpoint Analytics (which gives insight into boot times, app crashes, etc.) or third-party DEX platforms. The key is showing that UEM is not just about locking down devices, but also about proactively improving performance and user productivity. For instance, analyzing telemetry to identify an application that frequently hangs laptops and then rolling out a remedial update via Intune – that demonstrates both technical skill and user-centric thinking.
Finally, naming updates and cross-platform support are worth noting. In an interview, using the current terminology shows you stay up to date. For example, you would refer to Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) when talking about identity, or Microsoft Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr) when referring to the on-prem SCCM component – and how co-management between ConfigMgr and Intune can bridge traditional and modern management during a transition period. If you have experience migrating from legacy Group Policy to Intune policies or implementing Windows Autopilot for zero-touch provisioning, those are excellent modern topics to bring up. It demonstrates your ability to implement cloud-native endpoint management approaches that are prevalent in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="ai-and-modern-management-sample-interview-questions-2025">AI and Modern Management: Sample Interview Questions (2025)</h2>
<p>In this section, we provide sample forward-looking interview questions that reflect the themes discussed above. These questions focus on AI-enhanced productivity and modern management scenarios that EUC engineers should be prepared to handle:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>AI Assistants in the Enterprise:How would you integrate an AI assistant like Microsoft 365 Copilot or Windows Copilot into your organization’s EUC environment while ensuring data privacy and security compliance?
What the interviewer is looking for: Awareness of AI governance – e.g. setting up policies to prevent sensitive data leakage via Copilot, training users on best practices, and perhaps leveraging AI usage reports. Also, understanding the productivity benefits (automation of routine tasks, faster content creation) and how to balance those with oversight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing Cloud PCs in a Hybrid Setup:What factors would you consider when deploying Microsoft Cloud PC (Windows 365) for a workforce that also uses on-premises PCs and laptops?
What the interviewer is looking for: Knowledge of hybrid Azure AD join vs. Azure AD join for Cloud PCs, networking (e.g. connecting Cloud PCs to on-prem networks via vNet integration), licensing and cost management, and user experience (e.g. ensuring sufficient bandwidth, peripheral compatibility). Mention how you’d use Intune to manage Cloud PCs alongside physical PCs in one console, and enforce consistent security policies on both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation and AI Agents:How do you approach compliance and control when using automated AI agents in endpoint management (for example, Intune’s Vulnerability Remediation Agent or other self-healing scripts)?
What the interviewer is looking for: An understanding of AI-driven automation in IT. You should discuss setting clear policies for what automated agents are allowed to do (e.g. auto-install patches, reboot devices off-hours), monitoring the agent’s actions through logs or dashboards, and having fallback procedures if the AI suggests an incorrect remediation. It’s great to mention that the first Security Copilot agent in Intune went live in 2025 to auto-fix vulnerabilities – showing you stay current – and then talk about how you’d govern such tools (perhaps requiring approvals for certain actions, or gradually rolling it out in audit mode).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero Trust Enforcement:In a Zero Trust model, how would you ensure that only trusted users and devices can access sensitive applications?
What the interviewer is looking for: Practical steps: requiring MFA for all users, using Conditional Access policies that check device compliance and user risk level, leveraging device attestation (TPM, device compliance status from Intune) and perhaps continuous access evaluation. Also, an understanding that Zero Trust is an ongoing effort – you might mention conducting periodic access reviews or using tools like Defender for Endpoint to feed risk signals into access decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unified Endpoint Management Strategy:Can you describe your approach to managing a mixed environment of Windows, macOS, mobile devices, and IoT endpoints through a unified platform?
What the interviewer is looking for: Experience or strategy with UEM. For example, using Intune’s cross-platform capabilities (mentioning specific support for macOS, iOS, Android), leveraging device compliance across all OS types, and integrating other solutions if needed (like using Microsoft’s Azure AD for identity across platforms, or integrating an alternative MDM for a platform if Intune doesn’t meet a niche requirement). The interviewer wants to see you avoid siloed management – you should talk about one strategy/policy set applied consistently, role-based access for IT admins in the UEM tool, and consolidated reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI’s Impact on EUC Roles:With increasing automation and AI in EUC, how do you see the role of an EUC Engineer evolving over the next 2-3 years?
What the interviewer is looking for: Forward-thinking. A great answer might be: EUC Engineers will spend less time on “hands-on” device fiddling and more time on policy creation, automation design, and analytics. They’ll coordinate closely with security (as endpoints are frontlines for cyber defense) and with user experience teams (to improve productivity). Also, mention that EUC Engineers will likely oversee AI tools that support end-users (like virtual assistants, chatbot helpdesks), which requires understanding both IT infrastructure and user workflows. This shows you’re adapting to change rather than fearing it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By preparing for questions like these, candidates can demonstrate a modern skill set that aligns with the current state of EUC. Likewise, interviewers can use these questions to probe a candidate’s depth of knowledge in emerging areas. The end-user computing field is dynamic and continually advancing – showing familiarity with 2025’s key concepts (AI, cloud, security, and automation) will set apart those who are ready to lead the next generation of EUC solutions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Staying current is critical for EUC engineers, as 2025 brings an exciting convergence of technologies: AI copilots working alongside us, Cloud PCs delivering Windows in new ways, and management tools becoming smarter and more unified. The interview process will increasingly emphasize strategic thinking about these tools – not just “Can you fix a printer?” but “Can you architect a secure, efficient digital workspace leveraging the latest innovations?” Use this updated guide to refresh your knowledge of important trends and to practice articulating your experience with modern EUC platforms. With a strong grasp of both foundational EUC skills and forward-looking concepts, you’ll be well-equipped to ace that interview and thrive in the evolving world of end-user computing. Good luck!
